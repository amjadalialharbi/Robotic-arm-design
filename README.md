## 5 Degrees of Freedom:
- The arm has 5 joints, allowing it to move and rotate in many ways. This flexibility helps it reach different positions and angles.

- This type of robotic arm is useful for precise tasks and handling delicate objects, like automated assembly and careful object manipulation.
